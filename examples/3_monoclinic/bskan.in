# |___1) If you put separator "_", such as -0.01_0.01_0.02 this case,
#	   it is regarded as MIN MAX INCREMENTS to make list. So result will be [-0.01, 0.01] in this example.
# 	2) If the separator is & symbol, it is regarded as ingredients of lists.
# 	   For example, 0.02 & 0.05 will be regarded as [0.02, 0.05].
#	3) Or you can write the combination of 1) and 2).
#	   For example, "-0.05_0.01_0.02 & 0.00" will give you array([-0.05,-0.03,-0.01,0.,0.01])
